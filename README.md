# hello-world
my very first git repository EVER

31AUG2017<br />
Greetings and Salutations!<br />
In this stage of the getting-started git tutorial I am instructed to write a little bit about myself
in the readme file and commit (save) it in order to make this branch different from the master branch.

19APR2018<br />
Here I go again on my own!<br />
After reading a tutorial here on Github I'm now practicing the steps of making a branch (of the readme)
, committing these changes
, opening a pull request (asking the dev team (myself) to evaluate my proposed changes to the master project)
, and then putting on the other hat by responding to the request and agreeing to merge the new content.
