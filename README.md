# hello-world
my very first git repository EVER

Greetings and Salutations!<br />
In this stage of the getting-started git tutorial I am instructed to write a little bit about myself
in the readme file and commit (save) it in order to make this branch different from the master branch.

Here I go again on my own!<br />
After reading a tutorial here on Github I'm now practicing the steps of making a branch (of the readme file)<br />
, committing these changes<br />
, opening a pull request (asking the dev team (myself) to evaluate my proposed changes to the master project)<br />
, and then putting on the other hat by responding to the request and agreeing to merge the new content.
